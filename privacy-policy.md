## 3. Legal Basis for Processing (GDPR — EEA/UK)

We process your personal data only where we have a legal basis:

| Purpose | Legal basis |
|--------|-------------|
| Providing the App, account, and features | Contract (performance of our agreement with you) |
| Improving the App, analytics, security | Legitimate interests (balanced against your rights) |
| Marketing (if applicable) | Consent or legitimate interests, as disclosed |
| Compliance with law | Legal obligation |
| Sign in with Apple / Google | Contract; consent where required |

Where we rely on legitimate interests, we have considered the impact on your privacy and your rights. You may object to processing based on legitimate interests where applicable (see Section 8).
